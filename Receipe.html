  <h1>Delicious Donuts</h1>
  <p>"A simple, yeast-risen doughnut recipe that delivers light, fluffy rings with a subtle hint of lemon zest. Perfect for frying until golden and dipping in a sweet, classic glaze."</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Yeast</li>
      <li>Lemon</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the yeast with a warm liquid (like lukewarm milk) and a bit of sugar to let it "bloom" or activate.

Combine this mixture with the rest of your flour, sugar, and other wet ingredients (plus the lemon zest/juice for flavor).</li>
      <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and allow it to rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size. This process is crucial for the light, fluffy texture.</li>
      <li>Gently punch down the risen dough to release the gases.Roll the dough out to an even thickness.
Use a doughnut cutter or two different-sized round cutters to cut out the doughnut shapes.</li>
      <li>Place the cut doughnuts on a baking sheet, cover them loosely, and allow them to rise again until they look noticeably puffy. This second rise, or proofing, ensures they will be light when fried.</li>
      <li>Heat oil to the proper temperature (typically around 350 fahreheit or 175 celicus).
Carefully fry the doughnuts in batches, flipping them until they are golden brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
